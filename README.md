Module Title: Programming for Geographical Information Analysis (Core skills)

Module Code: GEOG5990M

Intoduction: Purpose of this project

This independent project allowed me to build an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that shows the movement of drunks a pub in finding their way home as well as stopping thier movement as they reach their homes.

Some important files were imported to the model to make the drunks able to move from the pub to their respective homes. 

These files included;

-First and foremost, the import operator was used to import all files and functions to create an agent based model.

-csv file which enables the drunks to be exchanged and listed on the model.

-drunk.plan.txt was imported to help read the code.

-Agentframework was used in order to establish drunks in the environment which helps in initialising the drunks, return the description of a drunk as astring of a text etc.

-Matplotlib.pyplot was imported to allow plotting of drunks , pubs, houses and make them visible on the screen for any code reader to easily understand what is going on in the model.
Matplotlib.animation was imported to get the model animated.

How the Drunk model can be run:

Below are the steps involved in running the Drunk model:

-The Drunk model can be run by clicking on the run file or pressing the F5 button in the anaconda spyder (version 3.7) python software.

What happens after running the model:
After running the code, you will see that all the drunks has successfully arrived home. None of these drunks is expected to be wandering around to find their way home.
